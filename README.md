IMPORTANT NOTICE!
PROJECT STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT (80% done)

Greetings.

This is my first project about using the full React functionality: hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, etc.), HOCs, Portals and more. 
Used Redux toolkit.
Additionally applied JSON server.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx json-server --watch db.json`

Runs JSON server. 
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

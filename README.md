Greetings.

This is my first project about using the full React functionality: hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, useRef, useCallback, etc.), React.Memo, HOCs, Portals, Context and more. 
Used Redux Toolkit.

Additionally applied JSON server.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npx json-server --watch db.json`

Runs JSON server. 
Open [http://localhost:3001/posts](http://localhost:3001/posts) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
